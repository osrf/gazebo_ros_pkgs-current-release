ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control (2.3.5-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Removed some debugging code.
  * joint->SetAngle() and joint->SetVelocity() are now used to control
    position-controlled joints and velocity-controlled joints that do not
    have PID gain values stored on the Parameter Server.
  * Position-controlled and velocity-controlled joints now use PID controllers
    instead of calling SetAngle() or SetVelocity(). readSim() now longer calls
    angles::shortest_angular_distance() when a joint is prismatic.
    PLUGINLIB_EXPORT_CLASS is now used to register the plugin.
  * gazebo_ros_control now depends on control_toolbox.
  * Added support for the position hardware interface. Completed support for the
    velocity hardware interface.
  * Removed the "support more hardware interfaces" line.
  * Contributors: Jim Rothrock

ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control (2.3.4-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * rerelease because sdformat became libsdformat, but we also based change on 2.3.4 in hydro-devel.
  * Merge pull request #144 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/144> from meyerj/fix-125
    Fixed #125 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/125>: ``gazebo_ros_control``: controlPeriod greater than the simulation period causes unexpected results
  * Merge pull request #134 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/134> from meyerj/gazebo-ros-control-use-model-nh
    ``gazebo_ros_control``: Use the model NodeHandle to get the ``robot_description`` parameter
  * ``gazebo_ros_control``: added GazeboRosControlPlugin::Reset() method that resets the timestamps on world reset
  * ``gazebo_ros_control``: call writeSim() for each Gazebo world update independent of the control period
  * ``gazebo_ros_pkgs``: use GetMaxStepSize() for the Gazebo simulation period
  * ``gazebo_ros_control``: use the model NodeHandle to get the ``robot_description`` parameter
  * Add missing ``run_depend`` to urdf in ``gazebo_ros_control``
  * Remove dependency to meta-package ``ros_controllers``

ros-hydro-gazebo-ros-control (2.3.3-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Eliminated a joint_name variable and replaced it with joint_names_[j].
    Modified some lines so that they fit in 100 columns. These changes were made
    in order to be consistent with the rest of the file.
  * Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/hydro-devel' into hydro-devel
  * joint_limits_interface is now used to enforce limits on effort-controlled
    joints.
  * Added "joint_limits_interface" and "urdf" to the component list.
  * Additional parameters are passed to robot_hw_sim->initSim(). These parameters
    are used by the joint limits interface.
  * Added "joint_limits_interface" and "urdf" to the build dependency list.
  * Added the robot_namespace and urdf_model parameters to initSim().
  * Added the urdf_string parameter to parseTransmissionsFromURDF().
