ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.3.5-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * update test world for block laser
  * this corrects the right orientation of the laser scan and improves on comparison between 2 double numbers
  * Initialize ``depth_image_connect_count_`` in openni_kinect plugin
  * multicamera bad namespace. Fixes #161 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/161>
    There was a race condition between GazeboRosCameraUtils::LoadThread
    creating the ros::NodeHandle and GazeboRosCameraUtils::Load
    suffixing the camera name in the namespace
  * Use function for accessing scene node in gazebo_ros_video
  * readded the trailing whitespace for cleaner diff
  * the parent sensor in gazebo seems not to be active
  * Contributors: Dejan Pangercic, Ian Chen, John Hsu, Jordi Pages, Toni Oliver, Ugo Cupcic

ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.3.4-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * rerelease because sdformat became libsdformat, but we also based change on 2.3.4 in hydro-devel.
  * Simplify ``gazebo_plugins/CMakeLists.txt``
    Replace ``cxx_flags`` and ``ld_flags`` variables with simpler cmake macros
    and eliminate unnecessary references to ``SDFormat_LIBRARIES``, since
    they are already part of ``GAZEBO_LIBRARIES``.
  * Put some cmake lists on multiple lines to improve readability.
  * Add dependencies on dynamic reconfigure files
    Occasionally the build can fail due to some targets having an
    undeclared dependency on automatically generated dynamic
    reconfigure files (GazeboRosCameraConfig.h for example). This
    commit declares several of those dependencies.

ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.3.3-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * gazebo_plugins: use shared pointers for variables shared among cameras
    It is not allowed to construct a shared_ptr from a pointer to a member
    variable.
  * gazebo_plugins: moved initialization of shared_ptr members of
    GazeboRosCameraUtils to GazeboRosCameraUtils::Load()
    This fixes segfaults in gazebo_ros_depth_camera and
    gazebo_ros_openni_kinect as the pointers have not been initialized
    there.
  * Use RenderingIFace.hh

ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.3.2-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Make gazebo includes use full path
    In the next release of gazebo, it will be required to use the
    full path for include files. For example,
    include <physics/physics.hh> will not be valid
    include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh> must be done instead.
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of gazebo_ros_pkgs <github.com:ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs> into synchronize_with_drcsim_plugins
  * change includes to use brackets in headers for export
  * per pull request comments
  * Changed resolution for searchParam.
  * Don't forget to delete the node!
  * Removed info message on robot namespace.
  * Retreive the tf prefix from the robot node.
  * synchronize with drcsim plugins

ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.2.0-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Fixed template

    It is sufficient to find gazebo, which will export the information about the SDFormat package.
  * ROS Video Plugin for Gazebo - allows displaying an image stream in an OGRE texture inside gazebo. Also provides a fix for #85 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/85>.
  * patch a fix for prosilica plugin (startup race condition where rosnode_ might still be NULL).
  * Added explanation of new dependency in gazebo_ros_pkgs
  * switch Prosilica camera from type depth to regular camera (as depth data were not used).
  * migrating prosilica plugin from pr2_gazebo_plugins
  * Removed tbb because it was a temporary dependency for a Gazebo bug
  * SDF.hh --> sdf.hh
  * Added PCL to package.xml

ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.1.5-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Include <sdf/sdf.hh> instead of <sdf/SDF.hh>
    The sdformat package recently changed the name of an sdf header
    file from SDF.hh to SDFImpl.hh; this change will use the lower-case
    header file which should work with old and new versions of sdformat
    or gazebo.

ros-groovy-gazebo-plugins (2.1.0-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * gazebo_plugins: always use gazebo/ path prefix in include directives
