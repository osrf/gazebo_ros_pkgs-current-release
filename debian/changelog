ros-hydro-gazebo-ros (2.3.5-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * gazebo_ros: [less-than-minor] fix newlines
  * gazebo_ros: remove assignment to self
    If this is needed for any twisted reason, it should be made clear
    anyway. Assuming this line is harmless and removing it because it
    generates cppcheck warnings.

ros-hydro-gazebo-ros (2.3.4-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * rerelease because sdformat became libsdformat, but we also based change on 2.3.4 in hydro-devel.
  * remove debug statement
  * fix sdf spawn with initial pose
  * fix sdf spawn with initial pose
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into ``spawn_model_pose_fix``
  * fix indentation
  * Merge pull request #142 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/142> from hsu/hydro-devel
    fix issue #38 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/38>, gui segfault on model deletion
  * Merge pull request #140 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/140> from ``v4hn/spawn_model_sleep``
    replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep
  * fix spawn initial pose.  When model has a non-zero initial pose and user specified initial model spawn pose, add the two.
  * fix issue #38 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/38>, gui segfault on model deletion by removing an obsolete call to set selected object state to "normal".
  * replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep
    time was not even imported, so I don't know
    why this could ever have worked...
  * Add time import
    When using the -wait option the script fails because is missing the time import
  * Use pre-increment for iterators
  * Fix iterator erase() problems

  * update gazebo includes
  * Fixed a minor typo in spawn_model error message when -model not specified
